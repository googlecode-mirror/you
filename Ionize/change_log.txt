   Ionize 0.9.5 CHANGE LOG

======================================================================


1. Global
  =======================================
   
   - New version... new design !
     Some design improvment were done.

   - No more MCrypt !
     MCrypt will only be used if available for data encryption.
     
   - "Search" module
     Provided as example, this is a basic word search module.
     It is very well documented and should help you to build modules for Ionize.

   - Complete rewrite of the Access() lib, which become the Connect() lib.
     The Connect() lib connects users both on the backend and on the frontend.
     Formerly, the host needed to have the PHP MCrypt function.
     Now, the Connect() lib uses the CI Encrypt capabilities.

   - Language based pages URL
     Each page can have an URL / language
     URL are built from page and article titles.

   - Some host doesn't accept CHMOD(0777). Removed the CHMOD error catch in application/media.php.

   - Ionize Media Manager : Post the media path instead of passing it by GET.



2. Installer improvements
  =======================================

   - The installer generates the global Ionize encryption key (first install)

   - Default language is defined through the installer (first install)



3. Ionize backend
  =======================================

   - URL auto-build from the page / article title.
     The page or article 'ID' becomes the 'URL'.
     Each page or article URL is localizable
     
   - Page / Articles drag'n'drop to create internal links.
     An article can link to another article or to a page.
     Simply hold down the mouse on the page name in the structure and drop it in the "link" field of you current edited page or article to create an internal link.
     The internal link will be available through the <ion:link /> tag of the article or page.

   - Complete rewrite of the Ionize structure manager (page and article tree)
     - The HTML of the tree is now much lighter (50%), reducing structure loading time
     - The structre supports now adding / update and removing of items without reloading the complete tree.

   - Integration of HTML syntax highlighting in tinyMCE (CodeMirror plugin)

   - Concept of "menus"
     Pages are now grouped in menus.
     2 default menus will be available after a fresh installation : "Main" & "System". These menus can't be deleted.
     An Ionize upgrade will put all pages in the "Main" menu, so the upgrade will be transparent.

   - View editing / saving from Theme panel
     The view editing feature is now working well !
     


4. Views and tags
  =======================================
   
   - PHP in views is now possible with the <ion:php /> tag
     This tag can also be added in articles HTML code : The PHP will be parsed.
   
   - Add of the tags :
     Conditional tags : 	<ion:if condition="..." />
       						<ion:else />
     						These tags are currently EXPERIMENTAL. So the best is just test them but not use them.
     						
     Article : Read More :	<ion:readmore paragraph="1" term="article_read_more" tag="p" class="readmore" />
     						In one article, displays a "red more" link to the article if the length of the content of the article is bigger than the "paragrph" attribute limiter.
     						Used in combination with <ion:article paragraph="1"> (with the paragrph attribute set), this tag is very useful because it will display the "read more" link only
     						if there is a bigger content to read.
     						
     Articles : keep_view :	When you set the Ionize "list_view" setting to a page, every article displayed on this page will use this defined view if more than one article are returned.
     						This is useful for displaying a list of summary and display the whole article content when clicking on the article, with staying on the same page.
     						But when you have for example some article in the footer coming from the "footer" page, these articles will also use the "list_view" defined view.
     						To avoid that, use "keep_view" attribute in the <ion:articles > tag of the footer articles.

   - Navigation : 			<ion:navigation menu="your_menu_code">
   								<ion:url />
   							</ion:navigation>
   							
   							When not set, the returned navigation items comes from "main" menu.
   							<ion:url /> returns now the complete absolute URL to the content for the current language
   
   - Languages :			<ion:languages>
   								<ion:url />
   							</ion:languages>
   							
   							<ion:url /> returns now the complete absolute URL to the content in the looped language
